Step-by-Step: Add New Project Folder to Your Git Repo
Letâ€™s say your new project folder is called my-react-app or my-django-app.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Move Your Project Folder Into the Repo
Make sure your project folder is placed inside:

makefile
Copy
Edit
D:\GitHub\Full_Stack-Projects
So the structure looks like:

perl
Copy
Edit
Full_Stack-Projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ my-react-app/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (React files here)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ ...
You can just drag and drop the folder there using File Explorer, or copy it via command line.

ðŸ”¹2. Add, Commit, and Push the New Folder
In PowerShell:

cd D:\GitHub\Full_Stack-Projects

git status          # You'll see the new folder as untracked

git add .           # Add all new files/folders

git commit -m "Add new project: my-react-app"

git push            # Push to GitHub


ðŸ”¹3. Verify on GitHub
Go to: https://github.com/Rukminiboda23/Full_Stack-Projects

âœ… You should see your new folder and its contents in the repo!
